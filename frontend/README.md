> My tiptop Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Add environment variables
Log in to heroku.com to get the env-variables. Add them to a new .env file in the root folder (frontend). Make sure to never push this file to the repository.

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

      <h2>Make your cookbook go cloudy</h2>
      <p>
        Â«Kokeboka miÂ» is Norwegian and means Â«my cookbookÂ». There is something
        special about storing your personal recipes in some personal space only
        available to you - recipes that you know by heart and want to pass on to
        your loved ones.
        <br />
        <br />In Norway, nothing is as special as grandmas Â«kjÃ¸ttkakerÂ» (meat
        cakes), but even though there are tons of recipes for kjÃ¸ttkaker out
        there, grandma's recipe is always the one and only. Kokebokami was
        created for those who want to save and access their handwritten recipes
        easily, without the struggle of searching to find the beloved book that
        the recipes were written into. Keep your recipes in a place where only
        you have access, and have the option of sharing them with the world.
        <br />
